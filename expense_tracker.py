# ðŸ”¹ Data Adjustments Due to Banking Inconsistencies
# --------------------------------------------------
# Some variable values related to deposits and expenses were manually adjusted
# due to irregularities in bank transaction records.
#
# The "Adjusted Amount" column represents the sum or difference of the
# transaction amounts above it. However, in certain cases, incorrect or
# zero values appeared.
#
# Example Issue:
# - Some transfers to another account were recorded as positive amounts,
#   leading to them being incorrectly classified as "Deposits."
#
# While such inconsistencies could be handled programmatically in Python,
# trust meâ€”sometimes manual adjustments are the best approach when working
# with Kyrgyz banks. With 10 years of experience in this, I can confirm! ðŸ˜†
